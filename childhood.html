    <h1>My Childhood</h1>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>As a child, I loved playing soccer with my friends. I have fond memories of us playing in the park on weekends and after school.</p>
    <p>I also enjoyed drawing and painting. My parents would buy me art supplies and I would spend hours creating pictures of my favorite animals and landscapes.</p>
    
    <h2>Toys</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite toys was a remote-controlled car that my uncle gave me for my birthday. I loved racing it around the house and trying to do tricks with it.</p>
    <p>I also had a collection of action figures from my favorite movies and TV shows. I would make up stories and adventures for them to go on.</p>
